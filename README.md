## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to develop a page with grid, flex, mobile-first and much more about CSS3 and HTML5

```html
<h1 class="titulo">Build The Community Your Fans Will Love</h1>
```
```css

@media (min-width: 880px) {
  .header {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
  }
}

```


### Continued development

I'm focused on mastering HTML5, CSS3 JavaScript and JS.node technologies.
